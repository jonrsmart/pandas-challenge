## Observations From Analysis

### Demographics Breakdown
A primary observation from the analysis of this data shows that the users for this particular game are overwhelmingly male (+84%). In addition, the vast majority of players are between the ages of 15 and 29 (>75%). 44.8% of players are between the ages of 20 and 24. 

### Spending Breakdown
It should come as no surprise that the 20-24 age group spends the most in total dollars ($1,114.06). However, they do not spend the most per person. That price falls to the 35-39 age group. In addition, when looking at spending by gender while females spend less in terms of total dollars, the spend more per purchase and per person than males do. It would appear that the game developers would do well to more strongly target the female demographic to increase revenue. 

### Item Analysis
There appears to be some preference to purchasing more expensive items as the most popular and most profitable items are some of the more expense items in terms of average price. This may be due to perceived benefit gained by purchasing the item in increasing the players experience in the game.
